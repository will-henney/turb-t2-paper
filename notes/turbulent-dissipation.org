Notes on dissipation of energy in turbulent flows

* Points that still are not clear
- [X] Can the intermittency increase the variance of the temperature fluctuations enough to explain t2?
  - I am now more hopeful. At least, we can put bounds on the degree of Kurtosis required in order for this to work. And then it can be left to further work to determine whether particular mechanisms can fulfill that or not
- [X] What is the role of shocks at macroscopic scales in the dissipation of kinetic energy?
  - Are we double-counting if we add this into the budget for t2? /Answer: No/
  - [2024-11-04 Mon] I now have a much better understanding of this point. The total energy dissipation is shared between three regimes: (1) injection-scale shocks, (2) turbulent cascade to viscosity around the Kolmogorov scale \eta, (3) collisionless magneto-turbulent cascade to ohmic dissipation or reconnection around the magnetic Kolmogorov scale \eta_m.
    - MHD simulations suggest that (1) and (2+3) are roughly equal in terms of energy dissipation. See [[id:0A896555-5AFF-4E9E-B82D-1743C1D8EC46][Park & Ryu 2019]]
    - [ ] Division between 2 and 3 is less clear. I still need to do more reading of Lazarian papers. On the other hand, it does not really matter so long as both have high intermittency, which we think they do.
  - The important difference from the point of view of the temperature fluctuations is that (2) and (3) occur at scales much smaller than the cooling length, and more importantly, timescales much smaller than the cooling time.
    - As a result, \epsilon can be considered as an additional microscopic heating term. So temperature fluctuations must come from spatial variations in \epsilon, which in turn come from the intermittency of the turbulent cascade (through kurtosis of the velocity gradients).
    - Whereas with the large-scale shocks (1), the cooling length is small, and so it is the non-equilibrium thermal history of the cooling gas that contributes to the temperature fluctuations directly.
- [ ] What is going on with the Taylor-scale Reynolds number Re_\lambda in the direct numerical simulations?
  - How is it that they can work with Re_\lambda = 1000 (implying Re = 1e6) and be able to numerically resolve from the integral scale down to the Kolmogorov scale?
  - [2024-11-04 Mon] I suspect that this is because they are not trying to resolve the Kolmogorov scale.
    - For instance, [[id:33F6C3BC-9457-4F79-9F04-073AA21752AA][Beattie et al. 2024]] claim that their grid size of 10080 cubed corresponds to Re_L = 3e6.
    - From [[id:3B01716E-7C2C-4B5C-BDD8-6D1B60B8A31D][Kolmogorov scale, \eta]] this means \eta / L = Re_L^{-3/4} = 1.4e-5, so their cell size is 7 \eta. This is not too bad, but is clearly not enough for DNS
    - From [[id:C90FB294-372E-4E30-B5EB-4174476DA5AF][Taylor microscale, \lambda]] we have \lambda_g / L = sqrt(10) Re^(-1/2) = 1.8e-3, so cell size is 0.055 \lambda_g, or \lambda_g = 18 cells, so *The Taylor microscale is well-resolved*. Note that the Taylor-scale Reynolds number is R_\lambda = ((20/3) Re_L)^{1/2} = 4500. 

* Summary of important points
- Turbulent energy dissipation, \varepsilon, is intermittent with extreme events dominating the dissipation
- The variance of \varepsilon increases markedly with Reynolds number, being of order \langle \epsilon^2 \rangle \approx 50 \langle\epsilon\rangle^2 for Re_\lambda = 1e4
  - Laboratory experiments suggest scaling as \langle\epsilon^{2}\rangle/\langle\epsilon\rangle^2 \sim Re_\lambda^{0.39} for Re_\lambda < 1e3
    - This is estimated from the kurtosis of the velocity gradients: K_(∂u/∂x) ≡ ⟨(∂u/∂x)^4⟩/⟨(∂u/∂x)^2⟩^2 = 15 \langle \epsilon^2 \rangle / 7 \langle \epsilon \rangle^2 (note K = 3 for a Gaussian distribution)
  - But there are arguments that the scaling should get steeper at higher Re_\lambda due to nested substructures in the flow
    - for sufficiently high Re_\lambda the "significant shear layers" themselves have a high Reynolds number and their own nested sub-layers
- For an H II region in thermal equilibrium, a small extra heating rate \epsilon in addition to the photoionization heating E will lead to a fractional temperature increase of t \equiv \delta T / T_0 = 0.36 \epsilon / E
  - The factor 0.36 is really 1/(a+b), where a = d ln \Lambda / d ln T and b = -d ln E / d ln T
  - This is assuming a = 2.3, and b = 0.5
  - This assumes that the turbulent heating timescale (interval between heating events) is short compared with the radiative cooling timescale
    - The opposite limit is applicable at large scales, where we will see the range of cooling temperatures spread out over the cooling length, such as behind a shock. This has to be treated separately. See [[id:9D7D03F7-1495-4092-BDDA-C1503882D1A1][Cooling length behind shocks]]
- Therefore, there is a linear relation between \langle \epsilon^2 \rangle and t^2 as it is classically defined.
  - t^2 \equiv \langle (\delta T)^2 \rangle / T_0^2 
  - t^2 = 0.13 \langle \epsilon^2 \rangle / E^2 = 0.13 \langle\epsilon^{2}\rangle/\langle\epsilon\rangle^2  (\langle\epsilon\rangle/E)^2
  - The first term comes from the kurtosis
    - We will normalize at Re_\lambda = 1e3, since that is where the lab measurements seem to be reliable, K = 15 and beyond which there is some doubt about the power law index
    - So put K = 15 (Re_\lambda / 1e3)^\beta, where \beta = 0.39 for Gylfason or \approx 1 for Elsinga
    - So \langle\epsilon^{2}\rangle/\langle\epsilon\rangle^2 = 7 K / 15 = 7 (Re_\lambda / 1e3)^\beta
  - While the second term comes from
    - background turbulent dissipation rate \langle \epsilon \rangle = \rho v^3 / L, where L is the integral scale
    - photoelectric heating rate E = k T_* \alpha_B n^2
    - so that \langle\epsilon\rangle/E \approx (R_S/L) (T_0/T_*) (c_s/c) Ma^3 f / U
      - where R_S is the Stromgren radius, c_s is the sound speed, Ma is the Mach number, f is the filling factor, and U is the ionization parameter
      - [ ] /check over the above equation, which comes from the Apple Note/
    - From the Javier paper we find L = 1.44 r_0 (assuming m = 1) and r_0 \approx 0.02 D = 0.04 R_S, so R_S/L \approx 17.4
      - [X] /Modification to the Javier result?/ -- the above assumes that D = 2 R_S, but D is measured from a low isophote and includes a faint halo around the H II region. It might be better to use the fwhm of the brightness profile. But this would mean decreasing R_S/L, which we do not want to do. *Resolution: no change for now*
    - For regions ionized by O stars, typically T_0/T_* = 0.25
      - I should calculate the photoelectric heating rate explicitly from integrating the spectra in frequency
    - With c_s = 13 km/s, c_s/c = 4.34e-5
    - So \langle\epsilon\rangle/E \approx 1.89e-4 Ma^3 f / U
    - Ionization parameter is typically 0.02 and f \approx 1 for low to moderate luminosity regions
    - So \langle\epsilon\rangle/E \approx 9.45e-3 Ma^3
  - So, t^2 = 0.13 7 (Re_\lambda / 1e3)^\beta (9.45e-3 Ma^3)^2 = 8.13e-5 (Re_\lambda / 1e3)^\beta Ma^6
    - We really want this to get up to about 0.003 or higher for the low Mach number regions, so we really need Re_\lambda to be high
- For low-luminosity regions, we expect that photoevaporation flows are the principal driving agent of the turbulence, but for higher luminosity regions, stellar winds likely place an increasing role. Something is needed to produce the increasing velocity dispersion with luminosity.


* Comparison of length and time scales
This is just a summary of results that are derived in more detail elsewhere in the notes.
- Proton gyroradius
  - (1.21e6 cm) \beta^{1/2} n_100^{-1/2}
- Proton inertial length
  - (2.27e6 cm) n_100^{-1/2}
  - below this scale, the electrons and protons decouple (electron gyroradius is 42 times smaller)
- Collisional mean free path
  - Electron-electron: (1.38e10 cm) T_4^2 n_100^-1
- Ion-neutral collision scale
  - Turns out to be unimportant if more than half ionized

- Ionization front thickness
  - (1.3e16 cm) n_100^-1
  - Will be smaller, since convex ionization fronts at base of photoevaporation flows have higher than the average density by a factor of a few

  - (3.46e19) U_0.01 T_4^0.8 n_100^-1 f^-1

* Definitions
** Ionization parameter
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
- Defined as U = F / c n, where F is the flux of ionizing photons and n is the number density of protons
- Relationship to radiation parameter, \Xi = P_rad/P_gas
  - \Xi / U = 15.8 (e_\star / f_euv) T_4^-1 = global value of 20 to 30 typically for H II regions ionized by early O stars (higher for late O or B stars)
  - See [[id:EE3830D5-75C8-41DE-AFA1-0B9130776009][Relationship between ionization parameter U and radiation parameter \Xi]]
- For a typical bright H II region, U \approx 0.02 and \Xi \approx 1
  - This is true for both the center of Orion Nebula and also for giant regions like 30 Dor
  - The Luminosities are 100 times larger in the latter, but the densities are 100 times smaller, so the ionization parameters are similar
  - For low-brightness regions, such as the EON, the densities are much lower (by a factor of about 100), so U is lower by factor of 5 or so
- We are interested in this here because we can calculate the Knudsen number and therefore the Reynolds number in terms of it
- Global value for an H II region
  - Although the density and (especially) flux will vary in the region, we can calculate a characteristic value using
    - F = Q / 4 \pi R_S^2
    - U = Q / 4 \pi R_S^2 c n
  - Then we use global ionization balance to eliminate one variable out of the set {Q, R_S, n, f}
    - Q = \alpha_B n_1^2 V
    - \alpha_B = 2.6e-13 cm^3/s
    - V = 4/3 \pi R_S^3 f
    - f is filling factor: fraction of volume occupied by dense gas (n = n_1), assuming the rest is effectively empty (n \ll n_1)
    - So Q = 4/3 \pi R_S^3 f \alpha_B n_1^2
    - f = Q / 4/3 \pi R_S^3 \alpha_B n_1^2 = 3100 Q_51 / R_pc^3 n_100^2
  - This gives alternative forms for U
    - U = (\alpha_B / 3 c) f n R
    - U = (1/c) (\alpha_B^2 / 36\pi)^(1/3) (f^2 Q n)^{1/3}
    - U = (1/c) (\alpha_B / 12\pi)^(1/2) (f Q / R)^{1/2}
    - U = (1/c) (1 / 4 \pi) (Q / R_S^2 n)
  - Putting in numbers (assuming \alpha_B = 2.6e-13 T_4^-0.8 cm^3/s)
    - U = 8.92e-4 f n_100 R_pc T_4^-0.8
    - U = 0.0130 (f^2 Q_51 n_100)^{1/3} T_4^-0.3
    - U = 0.0499 (f Q_51 / R_pc)^{1/2} T_4^-0.4
    - This is slightly different from what I derived last time
- It does depend on the filling factor of the ionized gas, but values of 0.02 are typical

    - At first it seemed weird that these values are so high (but this is now all resolved, see below)
    - For the cooler stars, f_euv is very low, which gives large ratios
  - For Orion, assuming Q=1e49, L=2e5 L_sun, we have T' = 5.5e5 K, \Xi / U = T' / 2 T = 32 (assuming T=8500 K)
- Alternative way of putting it:
  - Equivalent T of 1 Rydberg is 1.58e5 K
  - We can write L = L_fuv + L_euv = L f_fuv + Q \langle{}E\rangle_euv
    - where \langle{}E\rangle_euv is the average energy of an ionizing photon
    - f_fuv is fraction of bolometric luminosity emitted in the FUV and longer wavelengths
    - Probably clearer to write f_euv = 1 - f_fuv with f_euv the fraction of bolometric luminosity emitted in the EUV and shorter wavelengths
    - => L = Q \langle{}E\rangle_euv / f_euv
  - Also put \langle{}E\rangle_euv = e_\star k T_ryd where e_\star is the average ionizing photon energy in Rydbergs and T_ryd is the temperature equivalent to 1 Rydberg (1.58e5 K)
- So, getting back to the relation between radiation parameter and ionization parameter:
  - \Xi / U = L / Q 2 k T = (Q e_\star k T_ryd) / (f_euv Q 2 k T)
  - \Xi / U = (e_\star T_ryd) / (f_euv 2 T)
  - *\Xi / U = 15.8 (e_\star / f_euv) T_4^-1*
    - e_* is the average energy of an ionizing photon in Rydbergs
    - f_euv is the fraction of bolometric luminosity emitted in the EUV and shorter wavelengths
** Filling factor
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       20000488-8351-451C-AEC8-06C4B75C1F86
:END:
- Relation to coefficient of variation of density s_n = \sigma_n / \langle n \rangle
  - f = 1 / (1 + s_n^2)
- Relation to shell thickness for spherical shell model
  - For a shell of relative thickness h = \Delta R / R, the filling factor is f = 1 - (1 - h)^3 = 3h - 3h^2 + h^3 \approx 3h for small h
- Observationally derived values for Orion
  - Peak density n_0 = 1e4 cm^-3
  - Flux of ionizing photons: F = Q / 4 \pi R^2 = 1e49 / (4 \pi (0.1 pc)^2) \approx 1e13 cm^-2 s^-1
  - Thickness H = F / \alpha_B n_0^2 = 1e13 / (2.6e-13 1e4**2) = 3.84615384615e17 cm =
  - Baldwin et al. (1991) find peak EM = 2.7e25 cm^-5 for the Orion nebula
    - EM = n^2 H f, so with n=1e4 and f=1, we have H = 2.7e17 cm, very similar
  - So, we have H \approx R, so filling factor is not very different from unity
    - The model has R_in = 0.1 pc = 3.086e17 (they rely just fix the ionizing flux, so this depends on an assumption about the ionizing luminosity of 1e49) and thickness of 2.5e17 cm
    - Do the relative thickness is h = 2.5 / (3.086 + 2.5) = 0.448, so f = 0.83
  - Alternatively, we can derive it from the coefficient of variation of density
    - s_n = 0.66, so f = 1 / (1 + 0.66^2) = 0.7 - not very different
  - Baldwin also find an ionization parameter for the illuminated face of U = 10**-1.48 = 0.033
    - But the global ionization parameter is calculated at the ionization  front radius, so in spherical geometry would be smaller by a factor of  ((3.086 + 2.5)/2.5)**2 = 5.0 => U = 0.0066
** Cooling length behind shocks
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       9D7D03F7-1495-4092-BDDA-C1503882D1A1
:END:
- Start with shocks at the injection scale of \ell_in \equiv \lambda_in R_S \approx 0.1 R_S
  - So this would be the first shock for a given parcel of gas after it has been ionized
  - For most of the gas, this will be after acceleration in a photoevaporation flow
    - [ ] compare the rate of new ionizations from convex versus concave ionization fronts - /I think convex fronts should win/
  - For the larger neutral globules and filaments, with sizes of order \ell_in, this will be the large-scale termination shock of the photoevaporation flow with M_s \approx 2 - 3
  - For clusters of smaller globules, this will be oblique flow-flow interaction shocks, with M_s \approx 1.5
- In [[file:../../Orion-HH/shock-vs-shell/shock-vs-shell.org][shock-vs-shell.org in the Orion-HH project]] I calculate the cooling length, normalised to the final density
  - Final version of this is given in will-shock-emission.tex, where I show a simple analytic estimate that is independent of Mach number in the range 1-5, so long as you express it in terms of the final cooled density, n_2 = M_s^2 n_0.
  - Recast with the density normalization of 100 cm^-3 that we are using
    - d_cool = (7.4 mpc) (n_2 / 100 cm^-3)^-1
    - d_cool = (2.28e16 cm) (n_2 / 100 cm^-3)^-1
- Argument that n_2 should be on average of order the mean density in the H II region
  - The first shock in the photoevaporation flow will occur precisely at the point where the ram pressure equals the ambient pressure in the H II region
    - This will approximately equal the thermal pressure in the post-cooling shocked shell at the equilibrium T, which means that n_2 \approx \langle n \rangle
- Ratio of cooling length to Strömgren radius
  - d_cool/R_S = 0.0074 / (n_100 R_pc)
  - From [[id:ED1F0BA1-549F-4117-92EA-9CCEF82DBBB5][Reynolds number, Re]] we have n_100 R_pc = 11.21 U_0.01 T_4^0.8 f^-1
  - So \lambda_cool \equiv d_cool/R_S = 0.00066 U_0.01^-1 T_4^-0.8 f
  - So a simulation with 10,000^3 cells would be able to resolve the cooling. /This is actually feasible using adaptive mesh refinement/.
- [ ] We can use the previous result to estimate the /fraction of the volume occupied by cooling gas/ and hence *the t^2 contribution from the first shock*
  - Volume fraction is f_cool = d_cool A_S1 / (4/3 \pi R_S^3)
  - Where A_shock = 𝒜_S1 4 \pi R_S^2 is the total area of the first shock fronts
  - So f_cool = 3 𝒜_S1 \lambda_cool
  - From the simulations, it looks like 𝒜_S1 \approx 1 for the strongest shocks
** Ionization/recombination front thickness
- For the i-front, we will use 8 times the mean free path in neutral gas at the Lyman limit
  - \ell_ion \approx 8 / n \sigma = 8 / (100 cm^-3 6.3e-18 cm^2) = (1.3e16 cm) n_100^-1
  - Note that just outside of the ionization front there is a neutral heating front that is much thinner (because densities there are about 10 times higher than in the ionization front)
  - The factor of 8 is one factor of about 2 from the ionization fraction being about 0.5, and another factor of 4 or so from the mean energy of the photons being a bit more than the Lyman limit, so the cross section being smaller (especially important with hardening of the radiation at greater ionizing optical depths)
- Recombination front thickness can be taken as velocity times recombination time, where the velocity will be of order the sound speed.
  - \ell_rec = c_s / \alpha_B n = (1.16e6 T_4^{1/2} cm/s) / (2.6e-13 T_4^-0.8 cm^3/s) (100 n_100 cm^-3)
  - => \ell_rec = (4.5e16 cm) T_4^0.9 n_100^-1
** Magnetic Prandtl number
- Defined as ratio of viscous to magnetic diffusivity
- Pr_m = \nu / \eta
- Magnetic Reynolds number is related to viscous Reynolds number by Re_m = Pr_m Re
- I think that this should be approximately equal to the ratio of the mean free path to the Larmor radius: \lambda_mfp / r_L
  - [ ] See arguments in [[id:F78DE959-A732-45AD-A86F-76C214EBEC4B][Two-dimensional turbulence]] section, but it would be good to find an explicit equation for the magnetic diffusivity
    - The diffusivity can be derived from the resistivity, which is one of the transport coefficients derived in [[id:75B7F7D3-1B50-4414-9A4A-73C8E16661FD][Braginskii]] section
    - In Gaussian cgs units, the diffusivity is \eta = c^2 / 4 \pi \sigma with units of cm^2/s, where \sigma is the conductivity in s^-1
    - Note that it is confusing to have \eta as being both the magnetic diffusivity and the Kolmogorov length. 
- Assuming that this is right, then we have
  - Pr_m \approx (1.38e10 cm) T_4^2 n_100^-1 / (1.21e6 cm) \beta^{1/2} n_100^{-1/2}
  - Pr_m \approx 1.14e4 T_4^2 \beta^{-1/2} n_100^{-1/2}
- So in general Pr_m \gg 1, but it is not so extreme as in hot gas
  - At constant pressure it will go as T^2.5, so 1e5 times higher at 1e6 K. This is because the collisional lengths shoot up and the whole system becomes non-collisional (high Knudsen number)
- For high-\beta and high density, it could be much lower, but it is unlikely to approach unity
  - For instance, the proplyd ionization fronts can have n = 1e6 cm^-3 and I would expect \beta \approx 10, so Pr_m \approx 40
** Reynolds number, Re
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       ED1F0BA1-549F-4117-92EA-9CCEF82DBBB5
:END:
- Ratio of inertial to viscous forces
- Re = u L / \nu
- u is the characteristic velocity
  - In our case, we will write it as Ma c_s, where c_s is the isothermal sound speed and Ma is the rms Mach number of turbulent velocity fluctuations (we could maybe include the ordered bulk motions too, which would put a floor of Ma \approx 1, even for the low luminosity regions)
  - In Pope book, he uses a characteristic velocity of k^{1/2}, where k is the turbulent kinetic energy per unit mass: k = 0.5 \langle u . u \rangle = (3/2) u'^2, where u' is the rms turbulent velocity fluctuation in one dimension (so that would be the same as the \sigma that we used in the Javier paper).
  - If we follow that, then we would have u = Ma c_s / sqrt(2), assuming that Ma is the three-dimensional rms mach number: Ma = sqrt(3) \sigma / c_s
- L is the characteristic length scale (e.g. the size of the region, or the integral scale of the velocity fluctuations)
  - Pope uses the definition L \equiv k^{3/2} / \epsilon, where \epsilon is the turbulent energy transfer rate, but that will be circular unless we have an independent way of determining \epsilon. It can also be defined as the integral of the velocity autocorrelation function, which is about two times larger than the correlation length found from our structure functions.
- \nu is the kinematic viscosity
  - \nu = \lambda_mfp u_therm
  - for electrons u_therm \approx 550 T_4^{1/2} km/s \approx (m_p/m_e)^{1/2} c_s
  - \lambda_mfp \approx 2.625e5 T_e^2 n_e^-1 (ln \Lambda)^-1 cm
    - ln \Lambda = 9.452 + 1.5 ln T_e - 0.5 ln n_e \approx 19
    - \lambda_mfp \approx 1.38e12 T_4^2 n_e^-1 cm
  - Which gives \nu = 7.59e19 cm^2/s T_4^{5/2} n_e^-1
  - *This will only be the viscosity parallel to the magnetic field* - the perpendicular viscosity will be much smaller, with the collisional mean free path replaced by the gyroradius - the ion gyroradius, since this the perpendicular ion viscosity is larger than for electrons
- Estimate of Re_L for an hii region
  - Put L in parsec, and n_e in cm^-3
  - Isothermal sound speed m n c_s^2 = n k T => c_s = sqrt(k T / m)
    - m / m_p \approx (1 + 4 y_He) / (2 + 2 y_He) \approx 0.61 if He is singly ionized with y_He = 0.08
    - c_s = 1.16e6 T_4^{1/2} cm/s
  - So characteristic speed is u = Ma_T c_s / sqrt(2) = 8.23e5 Ma_T T_4^{1/2} cm/s
  - So u L / \nu = 3.3458e4 Ma_T L_pc T_4^{-2} n_e
  - This is disappointingly smaller than what I had previously imagined, but it still gives more than 1e6 for n_100 L_pc = 1
  - Put it in terms of the ionization parameter
    - Assume that U = 0.01 is typical for H II regions
    - From [[id:2227F4EC-2A33-4F3C-8645-CEC8FFD688F6][above]] we have U_0.01 = 0.0892 f n_100 R_pc T_4^-0.8
      - => n_100 R_pc = 11.21 U_0.01 T_4^0.8 f^-1
    - Furthermore identify L with the injection scale, which we can put as a fraction \lambda_in of the Strömgren radius, so L_pc = \lambda_in R_pc
    - Re_L = 3.3458e6 Ma_T \lambda_in T_4^{-2} n_100 R_pc
    - *Final form* => Re_L = 3.75e7 Ma_T \lambda_in T_4^{-1.2} U_0.01 f^-1
    - From the Javier paper we find \lambda_in \approx 0.1 and Ma_T = 0.5 to 2.5
    - f depends on the density fluctuations (see [[id:20000488-8351-451C-AEC8-06C4B75C1F86][Filling factor]]) but should be between 0.25 and 0.5 unless hot gas fills the volume and pushes all the photoionized gas into a very thin shell
      - Note that it was not necessarily a good idea to filter out the brightness fluctuations on scales smaller than the velocity correlation length, since we would then be missing the thin layers produced by the turbulence
      - Not too that if f were very small, this would also reduce the ionization parameter (for fixed density and luminosity), so that U/f is unlikely to vary very much
    - Taking \lambda_in = 0.1, T_4 = 1, Ma_T = 1, U_0.01 = 1, and f = 0.5, we get
      - *Typical integral scale Reynolds number:* Re_L = 7.5e6 
   
*** Taylor scale Reynolds number R_\lambda
- See [[id:C90FB294-372E-4E30-B5EB-4174476DA5AF][Taylor microscale, \lambda]] for details, especially [[id:8AC1C61A-72A3-47A8-ACDA-1BB8FB643846][Detailed argument from Pope, p. 198 et seq]]
- R_\lambda \equiv u' \lambda_g / \nu = sqrt(20/3) Re_L^{1/2}
- => R_\lambda = 15800 Ma_T^0.5 \lambda_in^0.5 T_4^{-0.6} U_0.01^0.5 f^-0.5
- Or using the "standard" values for the minor parameters (as with Re_L), we get R_\lambda = 15800 sqrt(0.1 / 0.5) = 7100, so of order 1e4
*** Earlier incorrect calculation
- From the calculation in [[id:FDD9A1A6-53E0-4220-AF9E-3EBB899CEF95][Knudsen number, Kn]] we find typically Re = 1e14 for H II regions
  - Very big!
  - Although, in my notes from 2021 [[id:F94CE6C5-5508-4F5D-BC24-482A5636C168][Reynolds number in H II regions]] I get a much smaller number - need to reconcile these
  - One of the differences is that I used the electron velocity to derive the kinematic viscosity
- Although that is for the scale of the Stromgren Radius. The outer scale of the turbulence may be 50 times smaller, which would give a Re of 2e12, but that is still big
** Knudsen number, Kn
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       FDD9A1A6-53E0-4220-AF9E-3EBB899CEF95
:END:
- Ratio of mean free path to characteristic length
- In my will-ckk draft from 2015, I estimate Kn for H II regions and find it proportional to 1/U where U is the ionization parameter. 
  - Kn = 3.76e-12 U^-1
  - Where U = 0.001 to 0.01 typically for H II regions
    - [ ] Note that this needs to be modified by the effect of filling factor
  - So Kn = 1e-10 +/- 0.5 dex
- From the Wikipedia page, there is a relation between Kn, Ma, and Re
  - But this assumes that the particle mass is the same in the viscosity and the sound speed, which is not correct for us since it is electrons that dominate the viscosity, but ions that give the sound speed
  - For isothermal Mach number, it is Kn = sqrt(pi/2) Ma/Re = 1.253 Ma/Re
  - 
- So for transonic turbulence (Ma = 1), we have Re = 1.253/Kn
** Magnetized or not?
- Although the low Kn means we are collisional on the large scales, we still need to check whether the small scales are magnetic or non-magnetic
- In the first case, we will have important non-collisional gyro-viscosity effects that isotropise the velocity distribution without really thermalising it
- Non-magnetic requires \Omega_i \tau_i, \Omega_e \tau_e \ll 1 where \Omega is the gyrofrequency and \tau is the collision time
  - See https://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/plasma/Plasma/node53.html
- So this is really important. I think the condition will be easily satisfied in H II regions
  - *No, not true*: the gyrofrequency is larger than the collision frequency
- So we have a contrast in the importance of magnetic fields
  1. They are not so very important for the injection-scale inside the H II region, assuming the v_A is roughly constant in the ISM (as suggested from David and Sundar's work for instance), since \beta = 2 c_s^2 / v_A^2. So if v_A = 3 km/s and c_s = 10 km/s, then \beta \approx 20
     - [ ] Although if there is a turbulent dynamo, then we could be generating more field inside the H II region - need to look into this
  2. They *are very important on small scales* because
     - electron Larmor radius is 10^5 cm for B = 10^-4 G
     - which is much smaller than the mean free path, which is of order 1e10 cm for n_e = 100 cm^-3 and T = 10^4 K
     - [ ] We really should be comparing these for ions too
** Collisional mean free path \lambda and collisional times \tau
- These are important since the kinematic viscosity can be written as
  - \chi_v = v \lambda
  - \chi_v = v^2 \tau 
  - I am using \chi_v instead of \nu to avoid confusion with the velocity v, since they look very similar with the font that I am using in Emacs:
    | LATIN SMALL LETTER V         | v  |
    | MATHEMATICAL ITALIC SMALL V  | 𝑣  |
    | MATHEMATICAL SCRIPT SMALL V  | 𝓋 |
    | MATHEMATICAL ITALIC SMALL NU | 𝜈  |
    | GREEK SMALL LETTER NU        | ν  |
- Or the dynamic viscosity can be written as
  - \eta \approx n T \tau
  - where T is the thermal energy per particle, T = (1/3) m \langle v^2 \rangle, so this is really k T (so that KE = 0.5 m \langle v^2 \rangle = 3/2 k T)
  - In all the plasma physics texts, T is measured in eV (even when they are otherwise SI)
- Going back to first principles. In the [[file:../../Documents/Ebooks/Misc-Physics-Astro/Fitzpatrick-Plasma_Physics_24_11_05_13_48_43.pdf][Fitzpatrick book]], Chapter 3 we have separate \tau for the four types of collisions
  - \tau_ee for electron-electron collision time
    : which is the mean time required for the direction of motion of an individual electron to deviate through approximately 90◦as a consequence of collisions with other electrons.
  - \tau_ei for electron-ion collision time
    : mean time required ... individual electron ... as a consequence of collisions with ions.
  - \tau_ii for ion-ion collision time
    : mean time required ... individual ion ... as a consequence of collisions with other ions.
  - \tau_ie for ion-electron collision time
    : mean time required ... individual ion ... as a consequence of collisions with electrons.
- Relative sizes of these (small to large) is
  - \tau_ee \sim  \tau_ei \sim (m_e/m_i)^0.5 \tau_ii \sim (m_e/m_i) \tau_ie
    : electrons scatter electrons (through 90◦) at about the same rate that ions scatter electrons, but that ions scatter ions at a significantly lower rate than ions scatter electrons, and, finally, that electrons scatter ions at a significantly lower rate than ions scatter ions.
  - The last must be because you need a larger number of interactions with electrons to significantly change the velocity of an ion, due to the disparity in the masses.
- For mean free path, we have \lambda = v \tau, with v_i = (m_e/m_i)^0.5 v_e, so
  - (v_e \tau_ee) \sim (v_e \tau_ei) \sim (m_e/m_i)^0.5 (v_e \tau_ii) \sim (m_e/m_i) (v_e \tau_ie)
  - (v_e \tau_ee) \sim (v_e \tau_ei) \sim (v_i \tau_ii) \sim (m_e/m_i)^0.5 (v_i \tau_ie)
  - \lambda_ee \sim \lambda_ei \sim \lambda_ii \sim (m_e/m_i)^0.5 \lambda_ie
- Full equation in SI units (Fitzpatrick) is
  - \tau_ee = 6√2 π^{3/2} ϵ_0^2 √m_e T^{3/2} / (ln Λ_c e^4 n_e)
  - \tau_ii = (2 m_i/m_e)^0.5 \tau_ee
- Numerical value in Gaussian units ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_parameters][Wikipedia]]) is
  - \tau_ee = (3.436e5 s) T^{3/2} / n_e ln Λ
  - \tau_ii = (2.08e7 s) T^{3/2} / n_e ln Λ
  - *Note that these have T in eV I think, so 11,605 K*
  - [ ] Check the units of T in all the equations for mean free path
*** Numerical values of the collisional timescales
- For a third opinion I take Geoffrey Pert 2021 /Foundations of Plasma Physics for Physicists and Mathematicians/ ([[file:../../Documents/Ebooks/Misc-Physics-Astro/Foundations of Plasma Physics for Physicists and Mathematicians - 2021 - Pert.pdf][local PDF]])

:ID:       52141FF2-4C80-4C77-9288-0B8A91EF492B
:END:
- /All in cgs Gaussian units/
- The Larmor radius is
  - r_L = m v c / (q B) where v is the velocity component of the particle perpendicular to the field
  - /note that in SI units there is no c in the numerator/
- Gyrofrequency is
  - \Omega = q B / m c
  - Electrons :: 1.76e7 B rad/s
  - Protons :: 9.58e3 B rad/s
- Related as r_L = v / \Omega
- We can write the B field in terms of the Alfvén speed, which we can put in terms of the plasma beta and the sound speed, since this latter at least we know
  - \beta \equiv P_gas / P_B = \rho c_s^2 / (B^2 / 8 pi) = 2 c_s^2 / v_A^2
  - So B = sqrt(8 \pi \rho c_s^2 / \beta) = sqrt(8 pi 1.08 m_p n c_s^2 / \beta)
    - Put n = 100 n_100 cm^-3 and c_s = 1.16e6 T_4^{1/2} cm/s (see [[id:ED1F0BA1-549F-4117-92EA-9CCEF82DBBB5][Reynolds number, Re]])
    - => B = (78.2 muG) n_100^{1/2} T_4^{1/2} / \beta^{1/2}
- So for thermal particles, we can assume 0.5 m v^2 = 0.5 k T, so 
  - Electrons :: v = sqrt(k T/m_e) =  3.89e7 T_4^{1/2} cm/s
  - Protons :: v = sqrt(k T/m_p) = 9.1e5 T_4^{1/2} cm/s
  - ratio :: electron speed is higher by a factor of sqrt(m_p/m_e) = 42
- Gyrofrequency  is then 
  - Electrons :: 1.76e7 78.2 1e-6 = (1380 rad/s) n_100^{1/2} T_4^{1/2} / \beta^{1/2}
  - Protons :: 9.58e3 78.2 1e-6 = (0.749 rad/s) n_100^{1/2} T_4^{1/2} / \beta^{1/2}
  - ratio :: electron gyrofrequency is higher by a factor of m_p/m_e = 1840
- Finally we have for Larmor radius
  - Electrons :: 3.89e7 / 1380 = (2.82e4 cm) \beta^{1/2} n_100^{-1/2}
  - Protons :: 9.1e5 / 0.749 = (1.21e6 cm) \beta^{1/2} n_100^{-1/2}
  - ratio  :: proton Larmor radius is larger by a factor of sqrt(m_p/m_e) = 42
** Ion inertial length
- d_i = c / \omega_pi
  - where \omega_pi is the ion plasma frequency: \omega_pi = sqrt(4\pi n_i Z^2 e^2 / m_i) = (1.3e4 rad/s) n_100^{1/2} Z^2 A^{-1/2}
- d_i = 2.27e6 cm n_100^{-1/2} for protons
- Wikipedia says
  : the scale at which ions decouple from electrons and the magnetic field becomes frozen into the electron fluid rather than the bulk plasma
- Interestingly, d_i and r_L,i are of the same order of magnitude
  - Huba says that Hall MHD corresponds to d_i \gg r_L,i, which corresponds to \beta \ll 1
  - So we are not in that regime

*** Braginskii viscosity
- Along the field lines this depends on the collisional mean free path
  - electron viscosity coefficient \eta_e = 0.73 n \tau_e k T_e
  - ion viscosity coefficient \eta_i = 0.96 n \tau_i k T_i
  - It seems that we should only be considering the ions (quoting [[https://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/plasma/Plasma/Plasmahtml.html][Richard Fitzpatrick]])
    : For this reason, the viscosity of a plasma is determined essentially by the ions. This is not surprising, because viscosity is the diffusion of momentum, and the ions possess nearly all of the momentum in a plasma by virtue of their large masses.
    - [-] *This means, we should revisit the Reynolds number calculation*
  - These \eta should be of form where \nabla.\Pi_ij = \nabla.[\eta dV_i/dx_j]  are terms in the momentum equation, so with units of force per volume, or pressure gradient
    - So \eta dV_i/dx_j has units of pressure, so \eta has units of pressure TIMES time, or (g/cm^3) (cm/s)^2 (s) = (g/cm^3) (cm^2/s)
  - So what is relation to the kinematical viscosity \nu that I have been using (also called viscous diffusivity \chi_v)?

    - And \chi_v has units of cm^2/s, so it is \eta / \rho
    - /So this is now all consistent/
      - The kinematic viscosity has the form \chi_v = \tau v^2 where \tau is the collision time and v is the particle velocity
      - So this is the same as \chi_v = \lambda v since \tau = \lambda / v
- Across the field lines, it depends on the Larmor radius
- 

*** Derivation of electrical conductivity/resistivity
- From eq 2.7 in Braginskii 1965, we have
  - \sigma_\perp = e^2 n_e \tau_e / m
  but this just depends on the collisions - nothing to do with the magnetic field.
- \tau_e = v_e / \lambda_e where v_e = sqrt(2 k T / m) is the electron thermal velocity and \lambda_e is the electron collisional mean free path

    - Good overview of the basic theory and numerical and experimental results for incompressible 2D turbulence
    - In 2d case, enstrophy still cascades to small scales, but *energy has an inverse cascade to large scales*
      - This can result in a condensation of energy into large-scale structures (big vortices), which is not seen in 3D turbulence
      - The energy is then dissipated by *friction* at the large scales, which is not the same as viscosity in their equations
    - Another difference is that the energy inverse cascade is not intermittent, unlike the direct cascade in 3D.
      - This would be bad news for us, except that other papers suggest that this may no longer be the case once you include compressibility
    - This paper taught me a new word, *palinstrophy*
      - This is the curl of the vorticity
  - Verma 2017 /Anisotropy in Quasi-Static Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence/ Reports on Progress in Physics
    - Abstract
      : In this review we summarise the current status of the quasi-static magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. The energy spectrum is steeper than Kolmogorov’s k−5/3 spectrum due to the decrease of the kinetic energy flux with wavenumber k as a result of Joule dissipation.
      : The spectral index decreases with the increase of interaction parameter. The flow is quasi two-dimensional with strong U⊥ at small k and weak U∥ at large k, where U⊥ and U∥ are the perpendicular and parallel components of velocity relative to the external magnetic field. For small k, the energy flux of U⊥ is negative, but for large k, the energy flux of U∥ is positive. Pressure mediates the energy transfer from U⊥ to U∥.
    - In MHD turbulence we have two Reynolds numbers:
      - The regular viscous Reynolds number, Re = L U / \nu
      - The magnetic Reynolds number, Re_m = L U / \eta
        - Where \eta is the magnetic diffusivity
      - These are related by the magnetic Prandtl number, P_m = \nu / \eta
        - This is the ratio of the viscous and magnetic Reynolds numbers
        - In the solar wind, P_m is of order 1
        - In the ISM, it is much larger, of order 10^6 to 10^12
      - *How can I relate this to the Larmor radius being smaller than the collisional mean free path?*
        - At first glance, the magnetic diffusivity \eta = c^2 / (4 \pi \sigma), where \sigma is the electrical conductivity, is not obviously related to the Larmor radius
        - The viscosity is given by \nu = \lambda v, where \lambda is the mean free path and v is the thermal velocity
        - The magnetic diffusivity must have the same units [cm^2/s] so that P_m is dimensionless, but I do not see how to easily how to cast it in terms of a velocity times a length
        - [ ] Roberts & Taylor 1962 /Magnetohydrodynamic Equations for Finite Larmor Radius/ might help
        - [ ] Huba 1996 /Finite Larmor radius magnetohydrodynamics of the Rayleigh–Taylor instability/ also maybe
          - Actually, this suggests that *the finite Larmor radius does not give rise to magnetic diffusivity*, because it does not enter in the evolution equation for B, but only in the momentum equation.
          - However, it does give a diffusive term to the momentum equation, so I can work out an effective viscosity from that
            : In the regime L \ge r_L finite ion Larmor radius (FLR) effects become important. These effects are incorporated into MHD theory via an anisotropic ion stress tensor in the momentum equation
          - The stress terms are of the form
            - d/dx { (n k T / 2 \Omega) (dV/dx) }
            - where \Omega is the ion gyrofrequency
            - I have added an explicit Boltzmann constant k, since the paper seems to be working with k=1
          - Comparing with viscosity in the Navier-Stokes momentum equation, we can identify the term in parentheses (n k T / 2 \Omega) with the /dynamic viscosity/, \mu = \nu \rho = \nu m n
            - Therefore, the effective kinematic viscosity is \nu = k T / 2 \Omega m
            - Where we can write n k T = \rho c_s^2 => k T = m c_s^2 
            - Also from [[id:52141FF2-4C80-4C77-9288-0B8A91EF492B][Larmor radius and gyrofrequency]] we have r_L = v_t / \Omega
            - If the ions are protons and the composition is mostly hydrogen, we further identify m \approx m_p and v_t \approx c_s
            - Giving viscosity \nu = c_s^2 / 2 \Omega = r_L c_s^2 / 2 v_t = r_L c_s / 2
          - So we finally have the result we wanted:
            - *The effective magnetic ion viscosity is a half the Larmor radius times the thermal speed*
            - So this exactly parallels the result for the collisional viscosity of mean free path times thermal speed.


** Bulk viscosity versus shear viscosity
- In the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, there are two types of viscosity:
  - The shear viscosity, \mu or \eta, which multiplies the shear tensor
  - The bulk viscosity, \zeta or \kappa, which multiplies the divergence of the velocity field (dilatational field \Theta). This is also called the second viscosity, \mu' or \lambda, although I have found examples where that is slightly different
    - For instance, in Buresti (2015) we have κ = (λ + 2μ/3).
- Note that these are in terms of dynamic viscosities. Divide by \rho to get the kinematic viscosities, \nu
- What is a suitable value for the bulk viscosity in H II regions?
  - On the one hand, Wikipedia says
    : In the kinetic-molecular picture, a non-zero bulk viscosity arises in gases whenever there are non-negligible relaxational timescales governing the exchange of energy between the translational energy of molecules and their internal energy, e.g. rotational and vibrational. As such, the bulk viscosity is 0 for a monatomic ideal gas, in which the internal energy of molecules is negligible, but is nonzero for a gas like carbon dioxide, whose molecules possess both rotational and vibrational energy
  - So this implies \zeta = 0 for protons and electrons that do not have any internal degrees of freedom (at least at the energies that we are interested in)
  - Buresti (2015) /A note on Stokes’ hypothesis/ makes the point that even if it is not zero, we can ignore it because its effect is much smaller than the pressure, but acts in the same way:
    : Indeed, rather than putting κ = 0, we may simply assume that the absolute value of κ div V is negligible compared to the thermodynamic pressure, i.e., that the following relation holds:
    : |κ div V| ≪ p_e.
    : In other words, with this assumption, we are neglecting any difference between the mechanical and the thermodynamic pressures. The rationale for this different approach and for its applicability stands upon the obvious fact that a term appearing in a relation or equation cannot be neglected just because it is small, but only if it is small compared to a qualitatively similar one, i.e., to one that has the same effect.
  - It will only be in very particular cases, such as CO_2, which has a very large bulk viscosity, that we will need to consider it. And clearly that does not apply to us

** Ion-neutral damping
- This is mainly studied in the context of low-ionization media, such as molecular clouds
- For instance, Hu et al (2024)
  - Below a certain scale, the neutrals develop their own hydrodynamic turbulent cascade, unaffected by the magnetic field, and unaffected by collisions with the ions (which are too rare)
  - While the ions are still affected by collisions with neutrals, so their MHD turbulence cascade is damped
- But in our case, we have much more ions than neutrals, so the first thing that will happen is that the ions are liberated from the collisions with neutrals, but that was never important for them anyway, so it will make no difference
  - The neutrals will still be feeling the effect of the ions, right down to the final scale where they completely decouple
  - So I don't think this is going to do anything for highly ionized regions

  - Re_L = 1e8 => R_\lambda = 2.6e4
  - I need to work through all these equations again to better understand the argument
- \lambda / L = sqrt(10) Re^(-1/2)
- For Re = 2e12, \lambda = 2.2e-6 L
  - This means that the Reynolds number at the Taylor scale is 2e12 2.2e-6 = 4,400,000
  - Still very big!!
- This is still much smaller than we could ever see in an H II region
  - In Orion, L = 2 r_0 = 0.14 pc, so \lambda = 3e-7 pc = 6e13 cm = 0.06 AU

   - Longitudinal autocorrelation R_11 \equiv \langle u_1(x) u_1(x + r) \rangle = u'^2 f(r), where u' is the rms velocity fluctuations of the turbulence (what I would call \sigma_turb) and u_1 is the velocity component in the same direction as the separation vector r. 
   - Microscale \lambda_f satisfies: 1/\lambda_f^2 = -0.5 d^2 f/dr^2 |_{r=0}
   - So for small r, we will have f(r) \approx 1 - r^2 / \lambda_f^2
3. The autocorrelation curvature can be related to the velocity gradients:
   - \langle (d u_1/d x_1)^2 \rangle = -d^2 R_11/dr^2 |_{r=0} = 2 u'^2 / \lambda_f^2
   - This is just algebra
4. Pope then switches to the transverse autocorrelation function R_22, probably because that was what Taylor worked with:
   - R_22 \equiv \langle u_2(x) u_2(x + r) \rangle = u'^2 g(r), where u_2 is the velocity component perpendicular to the separation vector r
   - Then a parallel argument to (2) yields \lambda_g^2 = 0.5 \lambda_f^2
   - Then we can rewrite (3) as \lambda_g = u' / \langle|d u_1/d x_1|\rangle_rms (/this is not in Pope, but it seems a super-simple way of expressing the Taylor microscale/)
5. Combining (4) with (1) then gives the dissipation rate as
   - \epsilon = 15 \nu u'^2 / \lambda_g^2
6. Pope then introduces the kinetic energy per unit mass, k /which I am guessing must be k = 3/2 u'^2, assuming u' is the one-dimensional rms velocity fluctuation/
   - then defines L = k^{3/2} / \epsilon as the length scale characterising the large eddies
   - /this means that the energy transfer rate from the large eddies is \epsilon = (3/2)^{3/2} u'^3 / L which has a few more ugly constants in it than I would like/
7. And he defines the turbulent Reynolds number to be Re_L = k^{1/2} L / \nu
   - which from his definition of L yields Re_L = k^2 / \epsilon \nu
8. Combining (5), (6), (7) gives
   - \lambda_g^2 = 15 \nu u'^2 / \epsilon = 10 \nu k / \epsilon
   - => \lambda_g^2 / L^2 = (10 \nu k / \epsilon) (\epsilon^2 / k^3) = 10 \nu \epsilon / k^2 = 10 / Re_L
   - => \lambda_g / L = sqrt(10) / Re_L^{1/2}
9. Pope then relates this to the [[id:3B01716E-7C2C-4B5C-BDD8-6D1B60B8A31D][Kolmogorov scale \eta]], defined as (p. 185)
   - \eta \equiv (\nu^3 / \epsilon)^{1/4} 
   - This is the unique combination of viscosity and energy transfer rate (presumed equal to dissipation rate) that gives dimensions of length.
   - So \eta/L = (\nu^3 / \epsilon)^{1/4} \epsilon / k^{3/2} = (\nu^3 \epsilon^3 / k^6)^{1/4} = Re_L^{-3/4}
   - => \lambda_g = sqrt(10) \eta^{2/3} L^{1/3}
   - which makes the point that it is an intermediate scale, at 2/3 of the way down the logarithmic interval from L to \eta.
10. Finally, the Taylor scale Reynolds number is defines as
    - R_\lambda \equiv u' \lambda_g / \nu
    - => R_\lambda^2 = u'^2 \lambda_g^2 / \nu^2 = [from 5] u'^2 (15 \nu u'^2 / \epsilon) / \nu^2 = 15 u'^4 / \epsilon \nu
      - Use (6) to substitute u'^4 = (2/3)^2 k^2
      - And (7) to substitute k^2 / \epsilon \nu = Re_L
      - => R_\lambda^2 = (20/3) Re_L
    - *Final result:* R_\lambda = sqrt(20/3) Re_L^{1/2}
    - Or Re_L = 0.15 R_\lambda^2
11. Phew, we made it!
    - Note that R_\lambda involves the large-scale velocity fluctuations u', even though it is at the much smaller scale \lambda_g.
    - And that the RMS velocity gradient is given by u'/\lambda_g (see my comment on (4))

** Large-eddy simulations
- In the (compressible) turbulence literature, what are called Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) are simulations that resolve all scales of the turbulence down to the dissipation scale. This is only possible for relatively low Reynolds numbers, so is not at all possible for any astrophysical contexts.
- Instead, Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) are used, where the large scales are resolved, but the small scales are modelled. This is done by filtering the Navier-Stokes equations to remove the small scales, and then adding a subgrid-scale model to account for the effects of the small scales on the large scales.
- This is discussed in detail in Pope, Chapter 13, where he spends a lot of time discussing the traditional approach:
  - in which the small scales are explicitly filtered out on a scale \Delta, which should be smaller than the smallest energy-containing scales.
    - For homogeneous isotropic turbulence and for free-shear flows, this is about 10 times less than the integral scale, which is really large. They talk about doing simulations with 40^3 grid cells, which is wild!
    - For wall-bounded flow, it seems the energy-containing scales are much smaller
      : the size of the important near-wall motions scales with the viscous lengthscale δν (which decreases with the Reynolds number relative to the flow lengthscale δ).
      As a result, people do LES with near-wall modelling (LES-NWM), but this would not seem to be a concern for astrophysical flows (except maybe over asteroids, etc ...)
  - But then the numerical grid cells are chosen to be significantly smaller than \Delta so that the filtered equations can be solved to high accuracy on the grid without any influence of the effective grid viscosity.
  - The residual motions on scales smaller than \Delta are then modelled using for example an eddy-viscosity model. The simplest of these is the Smagorinsky model, which is a mixing length that is a fixed fraction of the filter scale \Delta.
- However, he also talks about a competing point of view, which I think is what is done nearly always in the astrophysical simulations. From p. 632:
  : The opposite viewpoint, advocated by Boris et al. (1992), is that no explicit filtering should be performed and no explicit residual stress model should be used (τ^r_ij = 0). Instead, an appropriate numerical method is used to attempt to solve the Navier–Stokes equations for \overbar{U}. Because the grid is not fine enough to resolve the solution to the Navier–Stokes equations, significant numerical stresses τ^h_ij arise. Thus, filtering and residual-stress modelling are performed implicitly by the numerical method.
  - Advantages of this approach:
    : (for a given grid size) as much as possible of the turbulent motion is represented explicitly by the LES velocity field U(x,t), and that energy is removed from U only where and when it is necessary to do so. It is argued that the details of how energy is removed are unimportant, just so long as there is a mechanism to remove energy from the smallest resolved scales without contaminating the larger scales. (This is similar to the argument used to justify the use of residual-stress models that perform poorly in a priori tests.) A further advantage is that the time and effort required to develop and test a residual-stress model are eliminated.
  - Primary disadvantage
    : the modelling and the numerics are inseparably coupled. Sometimes the approach is referred to as ‘no model,’ but it should be appreciated that this is an inadequate description: for a given flow the simulation results depend both on the numerical method and on the grid used. It is not possible to refine the grid to obtain grid-independent solutions (short of performing DNS). Another disadvantage is that there is no representation or estimation of the subgrid-scale motions that can be used for defiltering or in models for other subgrid-scale processes.

This will depend very much on the luminosity and age of the region

  + often show stellar wind bow shocks that are very small compared with the H II region Stromgren radius
  + Examples

    - Pismis 24
+ Small clusters, such as the Orion Nebula
  + are an intermediate case with seemingly conflicting evidence
  + X ray observations show large-scale (r \approx 2 pc) patches of hot gas that overlap much of the nebula (but not the brightest central parts)
  + [C II] observations show a large-scale expanding neutral shell that has been interpreted as due to a wind-blown bubble
  + Studies of absorption and emission line kinematics in the central region of the nebula suggest a much smaller wind-blown bubble
  + Evidence from wind-wind interactions with proplyds implies a very small free-flowing supersonic wind region (r < 0.03 pc)
  + Evidence from ionization shadows behind proplyds implies that the central low-density cavity has radius of around 0.1 pc
  + *Reconciliation of evidence* /In the parts of the nebula with dense photoionized gas close to the ionizing stars, the stellar wind is only important very close th the stars. However, the fact that this dense gas does not have 100% covering fraction means that the wind can escape and interact with the more diffuse gas further out. This interaction can create the large-scale features seen in the X-ray and [C II] observations. The sound speed in the shocked stellar wind gas is very high compared with the other velocities in the nebula, so it can quickly adjust to changing conditions and fill in any low-density holes that it finds./

** Radiation pressure
- We should work out the ratio between the radiation acceleration and some acceleration that is characteristic of the turbulence.
- It seems that the small scale structure of the acceleration is very interesting, with a kurtosis that is even higher than that of the velocity gradients, even for relatively low Reynolds numbers.
  - See Liberzon et al 2012
- But we really want the acceleration at the driving scale, which we can write as a_turb \approx dV/dt = V dV/dr \approx V^2 / \ell_in, where \ell_in is the driving scale.
  - So a_turb \approx Ma^2 c_s^2 / \ell_in, where c_s is the sound speed.
- The radiative acceleration can be written as a_rad = P_rad \sigma' / m_p, where \sigma is the effective cross section per proton and P_rad = L_* / (4 \pi r^2 c) is the radiation pressure.
  - For the ionizing radiation pressure on hydrogen, we have \sigma' \approx (1 - x) \sigma, where x is the ionization fraction, but it is best to use ionization equilibrium to rewrite in terms of the recombination rate:
    - \alpha_B n^2 x^2 = F (1 - x) \sigma n = Q (1 - x) \sigma n / 4\pi r^2
    - so (1 - x) \sigma = \alpha_B n 4\pi r^2 / Q assuming x \approx 1
    - so a_rad = L_* \alpha_B n / Q c m_p
    - where we have severa ways of writing L_*/Q in [[id:EE3830D5-75C8-41DE-AFA1-0B9130776009][Relationship between ionization parameter U and radiation parameter \Xi]]
** Gravity

* Turbulent dissipation rate
+ The mean dissipation rate is set by the energy injection at the driving scale or scales, which means that it is unaffected by anything going on with the turbulence
+ However, for turbulent motions on timescales shorter than the cooling time, the contribution to the temperature fluctuations t^2 depends on the /variance/ of the dissipation rate Var(\epsilon) = \langle \epsilon^2 \rangle - \langle \epsilon \rangle^2, which in turn depends on the Kurtosis of the velocity gradients. And this *does* depend on details of the turbulent cascade.

Title: /Extreme dissipation and intermittency in turbulence at very high Reynolds numbers/

: For homogeneous isotropic turbulence, the dissipation variance is directly related to the flatness factor of the longitudinal velocity gradient [19,20], which increases with Reynolds number [15,17,20].

Also

: Presently, there is no suitable theory to explain the observed Reynolds number dependence of the dissipation PDF, its variance and also its extremes.

Should note that they are only doing incompressible turbulence

They find that the mean-square dissipation divided by square of the mean dissipation increases significantly with Reynolds number. This is what should create the temperature fluctuations.

They calculate this from a quantity called F
: the flatness, F, of the longitudinal velocity gradient
which is defined as the ratio of the fourth moment to the square of the second moment of the longitudinal velocity gradient.

This is related to the dissipation rate by
: F = 15 \langle \epsilon^2 \rangle / 7 \langle \epsilon \rangle^2
and they say that
: the normalized dissipation variance is given by ((7/15) 𝐹 − 1)
where the "-1" comes from Var(\epsilon) \equiv \langle \epsilon^2 \rangle - \langle \epsilon \rangle^2, so normalized variance is  Var(\epsilon)/\langle \epsilon \rangle^2 = (\langle \epsilon^2 \rangle / \langle \epsilon \rangle) - 1

This does not matter since F \approx 100 for Re_\lambda = 1e4, which is the sort of regime we are interested in. Note that Re_\lambda is the Taylor scale Reynolds number, which is of order the square-root of the integral-scale Reynolds number.

They show their own model prediction and a single power-law from Gylfason et al 2004 ([[id:05430AD7-562A-4CD8-AFBB-A6FB1F603454][see below]]). These both fit the observational data equally well, but they diverge significantly at high Re_\lambda, with the current paper predicting much higher values from the increasing power more slope as the nested sub-structures ans sub-sub-structures are added.

Title: /Experimental and numerical investigation of compressibility effects on velocity derivative flatness in turbulence/

Abstract:
: Compressibility effects on the velocity derivative flatness F_{\partial{}u\prime/\partial{}x} are investigated by experiments with opposing arrays of piston-driven synthetic jet actuators (PSJAs) and direct numerical simulations (DNS) of statistically steady compressible isotropic turbulence and temporally evolving turbulent planar jets with subsonic or supersonic jet velocities. Experiments using particle image velocimetry show that nearly homogeneous isotropic turbulence is generated at the center of a closed box from interactions between supersonic synthetic jets. The depen- dencies of F_{\partial{}u\prime/\partial{}x} on the turbulent Reynolds number Re_\lambda and the turbulent Mach number M_T are examined both experimentally and using DNS. Previous studies of incompressible turbulence indicate a universal relationship between F_{\partial{}u\prime/\partial{}x} and Re_\lambda. However, both experiments and DNS confirm that F_{\partial{}u\prime/\partial{}x} increases relative to the incompressible turbulence via compressibility effects. Although F_{\partial{}u\prime/\partial{}x} tends to be larger with M_T in each flow, the F_{\partial{}u\prime/\partial{}x} in the turbulent jets and the turbulence generated from PSJAs deviate from those in incompressible turbulence at lower M_T compared with isotropic turbulence sustained by a solenoidal forcing. The PSJAs and supersonic planar jets generate strong pressure waves, and the wave propagation can cause an increased F_{\partial{}u\prime/\partial{}x}, even at low M_T. These results suggest that the compressibility effects on F_{\partial{}u\prime/\partial{}x} are not solely determined from a local value of M_T and depend on the turbulence generation process.

Introduction talks about "turbulence chambers", in which compressible turbulence can be studied. These work by having lots of piston-driven synthetic jet actuators (PSJAs) firing off into the chamber. It has the advantage that the mean velocity is low in the center of the chamber, unlike in wind tunnels (where the turbulent velocity is a small fraction of the bulk velocity).
: Opposing arrays of PSJAs can generate statistically steady and nearly homogeneous isotropic turbulence with a small mean velocity at the chamber center. 
/This is great, because it is the same with turbulence in H II regions, where the turbulent velocities and the bulk velocities are similar/
: The employment of PSJAs extends the velocity range of turbulence chambers from subsonic to transonic and even super- sonic regimes. Furthermore, the ability of PSJAs to generate statisti- cally steady turbulence helps evaluate flow statistics and take measurements for a long time without limitations from the time dura- tion of the facility.
They are mainly interested in investigating whether the universality hypothesis holds, or whether the large-scale flow has an influence on the small scale turbulent dissipation. 

- They have an integral scale Reynolds number of 900
- The chamber size is about 10 cm, with integral scale being about 5 times less than that
- The jets are fired with a frequency of 150 Hz, maximum jet Mach number of about 1.2 in blowing phase and subsonic in sucking phase
- Kolmogorov scale is about 0.06 mm
- Dilatation \theta is defined as \theta = \nabla \cdot u and they define highly compressive regions as those with \theta < - 5 \theta_{rms}
- They do DNS of both isotropic turbulence and planar jets, with Reynolds numbers from a few hundred to 14,000 and Mach numbers from 0.6 to 2.6. The grid sizes are about 1000 cubed, which they say is good enough to resolve the Kolmogorov scale.
- For the experiment, their turbulent Mach numbers are only M_T \approx 0.02 with u_rms about 5 m/s and mean velocities about 1 m/s
- Taylor microscale \lambda_x \equiv u_rms / (du/dx)_rms defines the Taylor-scale Reynolds number Re_\lambda = u_rms \lambda_x / \nu
  - They estimate Re_\lambda = 383 and 932 for their two experiments
- For two different scenarios, isotropic turbulence with Re_L0 = 900 and planar jets, they estimate that Re_\lambda \approx 100
  - which would give flatness F \approx 6 for incompresible turbulence
    - for instance the equation in [[id:05430AD7-562A-4CD8-AFBB-A6FB1F603454][Gylfason et al 2004]] gives 100**0.39 = 6.02
  - but they find much larger flatness, up to 20 for M_T = 0.9 in the isotropic turbulence
- They also find a negative skew in the the probability distribution of pressure–dilatation correlation: \Pi_D = P \partial u_i/\partial x_i, which increases as F increases
- Their jet experiments also get to F \approx 20, but this is for a larger Reynolds number of 900 and a much smaller turbulent Mach number of M_T \approx 0.03
  - The incompressible equation would give F = 14, although their data have about 8
  - So this is a modest increase of about 2, even at such a low Mach number
- They point out that the conditions of the driving seem to have an effect on the scaling of flatness with turbulent Mach number, with the deviations from the incompressible case starting at smaller M_T when the turbulence is caused by a faster flow, such as jets.

Title: /Multiscale Velocity Gradients in Turbulence/
Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics, Volume 56, pp. 463-490

A great review paper all about the velocity gradient tensor (VGT), A_ij \equiv du_i/dx_j. It is focused entirely on the incompressible case, for which the VGT has two invariants: Q and R (invariants meaning scalars that are independent of the coordinate system).

/In other papers, there is discussion of the first invariant P, which is the negative of the trace of the VGT, which is always zero in the incompressible case, but is the dilatation (divergence) in the compressible case, with P > 0 signifying compression/

: Q expresses the balance of enstrophy and strain-rate-squared magnitude
[[file:turbulent-dissipation_att/screenshot-20241023-084741.png]]
: R expresses the balance between enstrophy production (vortex stretching) and dissipation production (strain self-amplification)

This follows from an earlier decomposition of the VGT into symmetric part S_ij and antisymmetric part W_ij, where S_ij = 1/2 (du_i/dx_j + du_j/dx_i) and W_ij = 1/2 (du_i/dx_j - du_j/dx_i) (with implied summation over repeated indices). The antisymmetric part is related to the vorticity pseudo-vector: W_ij = -1/2 \epsilon_{ijk} \omega_k, where \epsilon_{ijk} is the Levi-Civita symbol, so the enstropy is \omega^2 = -2 W_ij W_ij.

Averaged over volume of a homogeneous flow, both Q and R are zero (because can be written as divergence of a vector).

: In particular, ⟨Q⟩ = 0 has the consequence that average enstrophy is equal to the average strain-rate-squared magnitude, and ⟨R⟩ = 0 means that average strain production is directly proportional to average enstrophy production. One consequence is that the net (local and nonlocal) effect of vortex stretching is to enhance the global dissipation rate (Carbone & Bragg 2020), even though it locally decreases it (as a sink in Equation 8) (Tsinober 2009).

Large positive Q means high enstrophy, which occurs in localised structures, associated with slight negative R. /I had thought these might be vortex tubes, but based on Thacker et al 2023, they might be sheets/

Large negative Q means high squared strain, which seems to be localised around the borders of the high-enstrophy structures, associated with large positive R. This is where the dissipation is happening. It is an attractor in the phase space of the VGT. Meaning that fluid elements from a variety of initial conditions tend to evolve towards it. /Actually, this is misleading. I had been looking at streamlines of the restricted Euler system, which neglects the viscosity and non-local pressure effects. When those are included, then the phase space trajectories are loops in the Q-R plane. See Baj 2024/

Title: /Direct numerical simulations of compressible isothermal turbulence in a periodic box: Reynolds number and resolution-level dependence/

PHYSICAL REVIEW FLUIDS 8, 084606 (2023)

Important quote from the Conclusions:
: As shown in Ref. [15], the classical incompressible scaling did not hold for the total energy dissipation field in compressible turbulence. Our DNSs confirmed that, as in the case of incompressible turbulence, the normalized solenoidal energy dissipation of compressible turbulence asymptotically takes a finite nonzero value (≈0.4) at high Reynolds numbers, i.e., in a range of the solenoidal Taylor Reynolds number Rλs = 168–761. However, the normalized dilatational energy dissipation values do not approach zero, as opposed to that expected in Ref. [15]. Instead, the values asymptotically approach a finite value at high Reynolds numbers (or may approach zero too slowly to observe in the range of the Reynolds numbers up to Rλd = 453). Spectral analysis of the energy dissipation reveals that the main contribution to solenoidal and dilatational energy dissipation for the case of Mt ≈ 0.3 comes from the wave-number range at kη ≈ 0.3. Furthermore, it was shown that the energy spectra obtained from the DNSs with a resolution level higher than 2 are convergent for kη < 1 in the case of Mt ≈0.3.

Title: /Cascades and Dissipative Anomalies in Compressible Fluid Turbulence/

Abstract:
: We investigate dissipative anomalies in a turbulent fluid governed by the compressible Navier-Stokes equation. We follow an exact approach pioneered by Onsager, which we explain as a nonperturbative application of the principle of renormalization-group invariance. In the limit of high Reynolds and Pe ́clet numbers, the flow realizations are found to be described as distributional or “coarse-grained” solutions of the compressible Euler equations, with standard conservation laws broken by turbulent anomalies. The anomalous dissipation of kinetic energy is shown to be due not only to local cascade but also to a distinct mechanism called pressure-work defect. Irreversible heating in stationary, planar shocks with an ideal-gas equation of state exemplifies the second mechanism. Entropy conservation anomalies are also found to occur via two mechanisms: an anomalous input of negative entropy (negentropy) by pressure work and a cascade of negentropy to small scales. We derive “4=5th-law”-type expressions for the anomalies, which allow us to characterize the singularities (structure-function scaling exponents) required to sustain the cascades. We compare our approach with alternative theories and empirical evidence. It is argued that the “Big Power Law in the Sky” observed in electron density scintillations in the interstellar medium is a manifestation of a forward negentropy cascade or an inverse cascade of usual thermodynamic entropy.

This is a scary paper!

From the introduction:
: These remarks might suggest that a high level of mathematical sophistication is necessary to grasp the essentials of Onsager’s ideas on turbulent weak solutions. This is not the case. As a matter of fact, Onsager’s ideas are closely related to standard physical notions of spatial coarse graining and renormalization-group invariance
I think they were trying to be reassuring, but it doesn't work for me!

Isothermal fluctuations. They do have interesting things to say about what sort of cascade we might have in the isothermal case in Section VIII:

: Within a Kovásznay-type modal picture, the slow magnetosonic mode seems the most plausible source of the observed density fluctuations. However, in our nonlinear theory, there is no cooling catastrophe in the first place. Large-scale cooling adds excess negentropy (deficiency of entropy) that feeds the cascade of negentropy to small scales. See Eq. (107). This necessitates “rough” density and temperature fields with Kolmogorov-type spectra. In our view, the cooling catastrophe is an artifact of attempting to describe nonlinear compressible MHD turbulence in terms of linear wave modes. There is no sound theoretical basis for such a decomposition and, unsurprisingly, the Kovásznay mode- mode interactions lead to empirically wrong predictions for the problem [167].

Title: /Shock Waves and Energy Dissipation in Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence/

Simulations of isothermal mhd turbulence with a variety of \beta values and Mach numbers. They include \beta_0 = 10, which is relevant to H II regions. The final \beta is lower (due to turbulent dynamo I guess), ranging from \beta \approx 5 (M_turb = 0.5) to \beta \approx 1 (M_turb = 2).

From the abstract:
: The energy dissipation at shocks, normalized to the energy injection, εshock/εinj, is estimated to be in the range of ∼ 0.1 − 0.5, except for the case of Mturb = 0.5 and β0 = 0.1 where the shock dissipation is negligible. The fraction decreases with Mturb; it is close to ∼ 0.4−0.6 for Mturb = 0.5, while it is ∼ 0.1−0.25 for Mturb = 7. The rest of the turbulent energy is expected to dissipate through the turbulent cascade.

They look at the statistics of the energy dissipation in fast mode and slow mode shocks. For high beta, it is the fast mode that dominates. They find that for low Mach number turbulence that roughly half of the injected energy is dissipated in shocks, whereas the other half goes into the turbulent cascade. For high Mach number turbulence, the fraction of energy dissipated in shocks falls to lower values (which is the opposite of what ChatGPT tried to tell me). However, over the range relevant to H II regions (0.5 to 2), it does not change very much.

Or M_turb = 0.5-1 the majority of the shock energy dissipation occurs in fast-mode shocks with M_s = 1 to 2.

Title: /Probing the nature of dissipation in compressible MHD turbulence/

Looks at statistics of intense dissipation structures in decaying isothermal MHD turbulence.

Classify according to type of structure: fast shock, slow shock, rotational discontinuity, Parker sheet.

They distinguish three types of dissipation:
1. Ohmic dissipation, \epsilon_\eta = 4\pi \eta J^2
2. Compressive viscous heating, \epsilon_comp = 4/3 \rho \nu (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u})^2
3. Solenoidal viscous heating, \epsilon_solen = \rho \nu (\nabla \times \mathbf{u})^2

They find that the compressive heating is unimportant for their simulations (I think this is just because they are looking at late times in the decay of the turbulence, at which point all the strong fast shocks have died away). Their intense dissipation structures have \epsilon from 4 to 15 sigma above the mean value. The dissipation structures are mainly sheets. 

Unfortunately, their plasma parameters are pretty far from hii region case:
- Reynolds numbers of up to 9000
- Prandtl numbers of 1 to 16
- Beta of about 0.1
- M_A \approx 1, M_s \approx 4

When P_m increases, they find that the Ohmic dissipation decreases relative to the viscous dissipation. This happens over all four types of dissipation structures. However, they do not cover the case of very high P_m, where there should be further magnetic-kinetic turbulent cascades within their viscous dissipation structures.

Has direct simulations of compressible MHD turbulence in a box, with a variety of sonic and Alfvenic Mach numbers. They include low-beta and high-beta cases (the latter are more relevant to us, since we expect the magnetic pressure to be sub-dominant in H II regions).

They mention that even in high-beta plasmas (magnetic pressure unimportant at the large scales), that because the turbulent velocity fluctuations decrease with scale, then at small enough scales the magnetic pressure will become important.
- /My comments on this:/ this is all very well, but
  1. [ ] The magnetic pressure is still smaller than the thermal pressure. I guess that the thermal pressure /fluctuations/ are smaller though, so they will be affected by the anisotropy of the magnetic field.
  2. [ ] Also, how to reconcile with the claims of the Elsinga 2020 paper that for high Reynolds numbers the velocity differences across the "significant shear layers" are of order the mean velocity?

This is still in the incompressible regime, but builds on a previous paper, which treated weak Alfven turbulence.

Mentions that [[id:A739C76C-F8E7-46C9-A04F-CB943B249FD5][neutral damping]] scale will give a lower limit to the scale of density fluctuations.

From their abstract, their most important results:

: 1. Density fluctuations are due to the slow mode and the entropy mode. Both modes are passively mixed by the cascade of shear Alfvén waves. Since the shear Alfvén waves have a Kolmogorov spectrum, so do the density fluctuations.

: 2. Observed density fluctuation amplitudes constrain the nature of MHD turbulence in the interstellar medium. Slow mode density fluctuations are suppressed when the magnetic pressure is less than the gas pressure. Entropy mode density fluctuations are suppressed by cooling when the cascade timescale is longer than the cooling timescale. These constraints imply either that the magnetic and gas pressures are comparable or that the outer scale of the turbulence is very small.

- [X] I need to study this argument in more detail
  - because at the moment, the cooling part does not make sense to me.
    - I suppose that in the isothermal case there is no entropy-mode cascade?
  - And the slow mode being suppressed at high beta is also something I need to understand better
    - Which mode is it that devolves into sound waves in the non-magnetic case
  - [2024-11-04 Mon] *[[id:C6A088AC-363E-43A6-BCE9-BC3B20DE0753][Eyink & Drivas (2018)]] claim that these arguments are not right*
    - Instead they invoke a negentropy cascade induced by the large-scale cooling
: 3. A high degree of ionization is required for the cascade to survive damping by neutrals and thereby to extend to small length scales. Regions that are insufficiently ionized produce density fluctuations only on length scales larger than the neutral damping scale. These regions may account for the excess of power that is found on large scales.

: 4. Provided that the thermal pressure exceeds the magnetic pressure, both the entropy mode and the slow mode are damped on length scales below that at which protons can diffuse across an eddy during the eddyÏs turnover time. Consequently, eddies whose extents along the magnetic field are smaller than the proton collisional mean free path do not contribute to the density spectrum. However, in MHD turbulence eddies are highly elongated along the magnetic field. From an observational perspective, the relevant length scale is that transverse to the magnetic field. Thus, the cutoff length scale for density fluctuations is significantly smaller than the proton mean free path.

: 5. The Alfvén mode is critically damped at the transverse length scale of the proton gyroradius and thus cascades to smaller length scales than either the slow mode or the entropy mode.

**** More detail on the entropy mode and slow mode
: Density fluctuations that obey the Kolmogorov scaling occur in homogeneous subsonic hydrodynamic turbulence. They are due to the entropy mode, a zero-frequency isobaric mode whose density fluctuations are offset by temperature fluctuations.

So this cannot work in an isothermal medium, because the temperature fluctuations are not allowed. Does this really mean that we do not have the entropy mode? And what can replace it for causing density fluctuations in an isothermal medium?

I think the answer might be given in the [[id:38E70922-87BD-4127-8A02-010B76484E30][next section]]

That is interesting that the density fluctuations are proportional to M^2, and so are steeper than the velocity fluctuations. Remember that this is in the incompressible regime.

I think that these "entropy fluctuations" from the dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy are different from the entropy mode mentioned above, and these would still be present in the isothermal case.

Title: /A measurement of the effective mean free path of solar wind protons/

Abstract
: Weakly collisional plasmas are subject to nonlinear relaxation processes, which can operate at rates much faster than the particle collision frequencies. This causes the plasma to respond like a magnetised fluid despite having long particle mean free paths. In this Letter the effective collisional mechanisms are modelled in the plasma kinetic equation to produce density, pressure and magnetic-field responses to compare with spacecraft measurements of the solar wind compressive fluctuations at 1 AU. This enables a measurement of the effective mean free path of the solar wind protons, found to be ≈4 × 10^5 km, which is approximately 10^3 times shorter than the collisional mean free path. These measurements are shown to support the effective fluid behaviour of the solar wind at scales above the proton gyroradius and demonstrate that effective collision processes alter the thermodynamics and transport of weakly collisional plasmas.

Contains a useful discussion of different regimes of collisional and non-collisional plasmas, with lots of references.

This is more relevant to the shocked stellar wind bubbles in H II regions, rather than the H II region itself (which is collisional).

:
: We present the first results from an ensemble of driven, supersonic, δu/cs = 4.3 ± 0.2, magnetized turbulence simulations that have a magnetic field being self-consistently maintained by the turbulent dynamo in saturation, providing a volume integral energy ratio of Emag/Ekin = 0.242 ± 0.022. The grids vary from 2520^3 (Rm ∼ Re ∼ 105) up to 10080^3 (Rm ∼ Re ∼ 3 × 106), discretised on a triply-periodic domain with length L. Presently, these are the largest supersonic, magnetized simulations in the world, almost an order of magnitude larger in grid resolution (and Reynolds numbers) compared to previous simulations in this regime (Fielding et al., 2023; Grete et al., 2023) and are the first simulations to resolve both a supersonic and subsonic cascade with a self-consistently maintained magnetic field. The simulations utilised over 80 million CPU hours distributed across nearly 140,000 compute cores on the high-performance supercomputer, SuperMUC-NG, at the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre. We integrate the 10080^3 simulation for t ≈ 2t0, where t0 = l0/δu is the turnover time on the driving scale of the turbulence l0 = L/2 (or equivalently kL/2π = 2), allowing for time-averaging of all key statistics across ≈ 2t0, making for robust, statistically significant results. We provide details on the simulation methods in 4.

* Other factors
In case the intermittent turbulent dissipation is not enough to reproduce the observed t^2, here are some additional factors that might help:

** Compressibility
- Nearly all of the theoretical and experimental work is done on incompressible turbulence, but we have RMS Mach numbers from 0.5 to 1.5, and even higher for the most luminous regions. How this affects the Reynolds number scaling of the dissipation rate is unknown. 

** Isothermality and the Bernoulli entropy ratchet
- The fact that we have an efficient photo-electric heating mechanism means that we can maintain an isothermal equation of state in the compressible turbulent cascade, so long as the dynamic time remains longer than the heating time.
- I think this means that we extract energy from the radiation field, via repeated isothermal expansions (entropy conserving) and shock compressions (entropy increasing), which increase the Bernoulli constant of the gas.
  - Expansion satisfy 0.5 v^2 + c_s^2 ln  \rho = b_0
  - Shocks satisfy \rho_2 = M^2 \rho_1; v_2 = v_1 / M^2
  - So we can imagine a cycle
    - Start with \rho_0, v_0 = 0
    - Accelerate to v_1 = M c_s
      - c_s^2 ln \rho_0 = b_0 = c_s^2 ln \rho_1 + 0.5 M^2 c_s^2
      - => \rho_1 = \rho_0 exp(-0.5 M^2)
    - Now have a perpendicular shock of strength M
      - \rho_2 = \rho_1 M^2 = \rho_0 exp(-0.5 M^2) M^2
      - v_2 = v_1 / M^2 = c_s / M
      - b_2 = 0.5 v_2^2 + c_s^2 ln \rho_2
        = 0.5 c_s^2 / M^2 + c_s^2 ln [\rho_0 exp(-0.5 M^2) M^2]
        = c_s^2 { 0.5/M^2 + ln \rho_0 - 0.5 M^2 + ln M^2 }
    - Put M = 1 + m with m \ll 1
      - 1/M^2 = 1 - 2m + 3m^2 - 4m^3 + 5m^4 + ...
      - M^2 = 1 + 2m + m^2
      - ln M^2 = 2m - m^2 + (2/3) m^3 - (1/2) m^4 + ...
    - b_2/c_s^2 = ln \rho_0 + 0.5 (1 - 2m + 3m^2 - 4m^3 + 5m^4) - 0.5 (1 + 2m + m^2) + 2m - m^2 + (2/3) m^3 - (1/2) m^4
      - constant term: ln \rho_0 + 0.5 - 0.5 = ln \rho_0
      - m term: -1 - 1 + 2 = 0
      - m^2 term: 1.5 - 0.5 - 1 = 0
      - m^3 term: -2 + 0 + 2/3 = -4/3
      - m^4 term: 2.5 - 0 - 0.5 = 2a
  - So this actually decreases the Bernoulli constant, which is not what I wanted
    - To leading order, b_2 = b_0 - (4/3) m^3 for M = 1 + m
- The whole idea is misconceived because the Bernoulli law only applies to steady-state flow, which makes absolutely no sense in a turbulent cascade.
