Notes on dissipation of energy in turbulent flows

* Summary of important points
- Turbulent energy dissipation, \varepsilon, is intermittent with extreme events dominating the dissipation
- The variance of \varepsilon increases markedly with Reynolds number, being of order \langle \epsilon^2 \rangle \approx 50 \langle\epsilon\rangle^2 for Re_\lambda = 1e4
  - Laboratory experiments suggest scaling as \langle\epsilon^{2}\rangle/\langle\epsilon\rangle^2 \sim Re_\lambda^{0.39} for Re_\lambda < 1e3
    - This is estimated from the kurtosis of the velocity gradients: K_(∂u/∂x) ≡ ⟨(∂u/∂x)^4⟩/⟨(∂u/∂x)^2⟩^2 = 15 \langle \epsilon^2 \rangle / 7 \langle \epsilon \rangle^2 (note K = 3 for a Gaussian distribution)
  - But there are arguments that the scaling should get steeper at higher Re_\lambda due to nested substructures in the flow
    - for sufficiently high Re_\lambda the "significant shear layers" themselves have a high Reynolds number and their own nested sub-layers
- For an H II region in thermal equilibrium, a small extra heating rate \epsilon in addition to the photoionization heating E will lead to a fractional temperature increase of t \equiv \delta T / T_0 = 0.36 \epsilon / E
  - The factor 0.36 is really 1/(a+b), where a = d ln \Lambda / d ln T and b = -d ln E / d ln T
  - This is assuming a = 2.3, and b = 0.5
  - This assumes that the turbulent heating timescale is short compared with the radiative cooling timescale
    - [ ] *need to check this* and think about what would happen in the opposite limit
    - On reflection, I think what we really need is that the interval between heating events is *short* compared with the cooling timescale
- Therefore, there is a linear relation between \langle \epsilon^2 \rangle and t^2 as it is classically defined.
  - t^2 \equiv \langle (\delta T)^2 \rangle / T_0^2 =
  - t^2 = 0.13 \langle \epsilon^2 \rangle / E^2 = 0.13 \langle\epsilon^{2}\rangle/\langle\epsilon\rangle^2  (\langle\epsilon\rangle/E)^2
  - The first term comes from the kurtosis
    - We will normalize at Re_\lambda = 1e3, since that is where the lab measurements seem to be reliable, K = 15 and beyond which there is some doubt about the power law index
    - So put K = 15 (Re_\lambda / 1e3)^\beta, where \beta = 0.39 for Gylfason or \approx 1 for Elsinga
    - So \langle\epsilon^{2}\rangle/\langle\epsilon\rangle^2 = 7 K / 15 = 7 (Re_\lambda / 1e3)^\beta
  - While the second term comes from
    - background turbulent dissipation rate \langle \epsilon \rangle = \rho v^3 / L, where L is the integral scale
    - photoelectric heating rate E = k T_* \alpha_B n^2
    - so that \langle\epsilon\rangle/E \approx (R_S/L) (T_0/T_*) (c_s/c) Ma^3 f / U
      - where R_S is the Stromgren radius, c_s is the sound speed, Ma is the Mach number, f is the filling factor, and U is the ionization parameter
      - [ ] /check over the above equation, which comes from the Apple Note/
    - From the Javier paper we find L = 1.44 r_0 (assuming m = 1) and r_0 \approx 0.02 D = 0.04 R_S, so R_S/L \approx 17.4
      - [X] /Modification to the Javier result?/ -- the above assumes that D = 2 R_S, but D is measured from a low isophote and includes a faint halo around the H II region. It might be better to use the fwhm of the brightness profile. But this would mean decreasing R_S/L, which we do not want to do. *Resolution: no change for now*
    - For regions ionized by O stars, typically T_0/T_* = 0.25
      - I should calculate the photoelectric heating rate explicitly from integrating the spectra in frequency
    - With c_s = 13 km/s, c_s/c = 4.34e-5
    - So \langle\epsilon\rangle/E \approx 1.89e-4 Ma^3 f / U
    - Ionization parameter is typically 0.02 and f \approx 1 for low to moderate luminosity regions
    - So \langle\epsilon\rangle/E \approx 9.45e-3 Ma^3
  - So, t^2 = 0.13 7 (Re_\lambda / 1e3)^\beta (9.45e-3 Ma^3)^2 = 8.13e-5 (Re_\lambda / 1e3)^\beta Ma^6
    - We really want this to get up to about 0.003 or higher for the low Mach number regions, so we really need Re_\lambda to be high
* Definitions
** Ionization parameter
- Defined as U = F / c n, where F is the flux of ionizing photons and n is the number density of protons
- Relationship to radiation parameter, \Xi = P_rad/P_gas
  - \Xi / U = 15.8 (e_\star / f_euv) T_4^-1 = global value of 20 to 30 typically for H II regions ionized by early O stars (higher for late O or B stars)
  - See [[id:EE3830D5-75C8-41DE-AFA1-0B9130776009][Relationship between ionization parameter U and radiation parameter \Xi]]
- For a typical bright H II region, U \approx 0.02 and \Xi \approx 1
  - This is true for both the center of Orion Nebula and also for giant regions like 30 Dor
  - The Luminosities are 100 times larger in the latter, but the densities are 100 times smaller, so the ionization parameters are similar
  - For low-brightness regions, such as the EON, the densities are much lower (by a factor of about 100), so U is lower by factor of 5 or so
- We are interested in this here because we can calculate the Knudsen number and therefore the Reynolds number in terms of it
- Global value for an H II region
  - Although the density and (especially) flux will vary in the region, we can calculate a characteristic value using
    - F = Q / 4 \pi R_S^2
    - U = Q / 4 \pi R_S^2 c n
  - Then we use global ionization balance to eliminate one variable out of the set {Q, R_S, n, f}
    - Q = \alpha_B n_1^2 V
    - \alpha_B = 2.6e-13 cm^3/s
    - V = 4/3 \pi R_S^3 f
    - f is filling factor: fraction of volume occupied by dense gas (n = n_1), assuming the rest is effectively empty (n \ll n_1)
    - So Q = 4/3 \pi R_S^3 f \alpha_B n_1^2
    - f = Q / 4/3 \pi R_S^3 \alpha_B n_1^2 = 3100 Q_51 / R_pc^3 n_100^2
  - This gives alternative forms for U
    - U = (\alpha_B / 3 c) f n R
    - U = (1/c) (\alpha_B^2 / 36\pi)^(1/3) (f^2 Q n)^{1/3}
    - U = (1/c) (\alpha_B / 12\pi)^(1/2) (f Q / R)^{1/2}
    - U = (1/c) (1 / 4 \pi) (Q / R_S^2 n)
  - Putting in numbers (assuming \alpha_B = 2.6e-13 T_4^-0.8 cm^3/s)
    - U = 8.92e-4 f n_100 R_pc T_4^-0.8
    - U = 0.0130 (f^2 Q_51 n_100)^{1/3} T_4^-0.3
    - U = 0.0499 (f Q_51 / R_pc)^{1/2} T_4^-0.4
    - This is slightly different from what I derived last time
- It does depend on the filling factor of the ionized gas, but values of 0.02 are typical

    - At first it seemed weird that these values are so high (but this is now all resolved, see below)
    - For the cooler stars, f_euv is very low, which gives large ratios
  - For Orion, assuming Q=1e49, L=2e5 L_sun, we have T' = 5.5e5 K, \Xi / U = T' / 2 T = 32 (assuming T=8500 K)
- Alternative way of putting it:
  - Equivalent T of 1 Rydberg is 1.58e5 K
  - We can write L = L_fuv + L_euv = L f_fuv + Q \langle{}E\rangle_euv
    - where \langle{}E\rangle_euv is the average energy of an ionizing photon
    - f_fuv is fraction of bolometric luminosity emitted in the FUV and longer wavelengths
    - Probably clearer to write f_euv = 1 - f_fuv with f_euv the fraction of bolometric luminosity emitted in the EUV and shorter wavelengths
    - => L = Q \langle{}E\rangle_euv / f_euv
  - Also put \langle{}E\rangle_euv = e_\star k T_ryd where e_\star is the average ionizing photon energy in Rydbergs and T_ryd is the temperature equivalent to 1 Rydberg (1.58e5 K)
- So, getting back to the relation between radiation parameter and ionization parameter:
  - \Xi / U = L / Q 2 k T = (Q e_\star k T_ryd) / (f_euv Q 2 k T)
  - \Xi / U = (e_\star T_ryd) / (f_euv 2 T)
  - *\Xi / U = 15.8 (e_\star / f_euv) T_4^-1*
** Filling factor
- Relation to coefficient of variation of density s_n = \sigma_n / \langle n \rangle
  - f = 1 / (1 + s_n^2)
- Relation to shell thickness for spherical shell model
  - For a shell of relative thickness h = \Delta R / R, the filling factor is f = 1 - (1 - h)^3 = 3h - 3h^2 + h^3 \approx 3h for small h
- Observationally derived values for Orion
  - Peak density n_0 = 1e4 cm^-3
  - Flux of ionizing photons: F = Q / 4 \pi R^2 = 1e49 / (4 \pi (0.1 pc)^2) \approx 1e13 cm^-2 s^-1
  - Thickness H = F / \alpha_B n_0^2 = 1e13 / (2.6e-13 1e4**2) = 3.84615384615e17 cm =
  - Baldwin et al. (1991) find peak EM = 2.7e25 cm^-5 for the Orion nebula
    - EM = n^2 H f, so with n=1e4 and f=1, we have H = 2.7e17 cm, very similar
  - So, we have H \approx R, so filling factor is not very different from unity
    - The model has R_in = 0.1 pc = 3.086e17 (they rely just fix the ionizing flux, so this depends on an assumption about the ionizing luminosity of 1e49) and thickness of 2.5e17 cm
    - Do the relative thickness is h = 2.5 / (3.086 + 2.5) = 0.448, so f = 0.83
  - Alternatively, we can derive it from the coefficient of variation of density
    - s_n = 0.66, so f = 1 / (1 + 0.66^2) = 0.7 - not very different
  - Baldwin also find an ionization parameter for the illuminated face of U = 10**-1.48 = 0.033

  - u is the characteristic velocity
    - In our case, we will write it as Ma c_s, where c_s is the isothermal sound speed and Ma is the rms Mach number of turbulent velocity fluctuations (we could maybe include the ordered bulk motions too, which would put a floor of Ma \approx 1, even for the low luminosity regions)

*** Earlier incorrect calculation
- From the calculation in [[id:FDD9A1A6-53E0-4220-AF9E-3EBB899CEF95][Knudsen number, Kn]] we find typically Re = 1e14 for H II regions
  - Very big!
  - Although, in my notes from 2021 [[id:F94CE6C5-5508-4F5D-BC24-482A5636C168][Reynolds number in H II regions]] I get a much smaller number - need to reconcile these
  - One of the differences is that I used the electron velocity to derive the kinematic viscosity
- Although that is for the scale of the Stromgren Radius. The outer scale of the turbulence may be 50 times smaller, which would give a Re of 2e12, but that is still big
** Knudsen number, Kn
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       FDD9A1A6-53E0-4220-AF9E-3EBB899CEF95
:END:
- Ratio of mean free path to characteristic length
- In my will-ckk draft from 2015, I estimate Kn for H II regions and find it proportional to 1/U where U is the ionization parameter. 
  - Kn = 3.76e-12 U^-1
  - Where U = 0.001 to 0.01 typically for H II regions
    - [ ] Note that this needs to be modified by the effect of filling factor
  - So Kn = 1e-10 +/- 0.5 dex
- From the Wikipedia page, there is a relation between Kn, Ma, and Re
  - But this assumes that the particle mass is the same in the viscosity and the sound speed, which is not correct for us since it is electrons that dominate the viscosity, but ions that give the sound speed
  - For isothermal Mach number, it is Kn = sqrt(pi/2) Ma/Re = 1.253 Ma/Re
  - 
- So for transonic turbulence (Ma = 1), we have Re = 1.253/Kn
** Magnetized or not?
- Although the low Kn means we are collisionally on the large scales, we still need to check whether the small scales are magnetic or non-magnetic
- In the first case, we will have important non-collisional gyro-viscosity effects that isotropise the velocity distribution without really thermalising it
- Non-magnetic requires \Omega_i \tau_i, \Omega_e \tau_e \ll 1 where \Omega is the gyrofrequency and \tau is the collision time
  - See https://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/plasma/Plasma/node53.html
- So this is really important. I think the condition will be easily satisfied in H II regions
  - 
- But one thing I am still not clear on is what the importance of magnetic field is in H II regions if we assume that
  1. They are not very important on the large scales, assuming the v_A is roughly constant in the ISM (as suggested from David and Sundar's work for instance), since \beta = 2 c_s^2 / v_A^2. So if v_A = 3 km/s and c_s = 10 km/s, then \beta \approx 20
  2. They are not important on small scales because
     - electron Larmor radius is 10^5 cm for B = 10^-4 G
** Taylor microscale, \lambda
- Supposedly the scale below which viscosity starts to have an effect - *not true* for very high Reynolds numbers
- From Pope, eq. 6.64, Taylor-scale Reynolds number is
  - R_\lambda = ((20/3) Re_L)^{1/2}
  - Re_L = 1e8 => R_\lambda = 2.6e4
- \lambda / L = sqrt(10) Re^(-1/2)
- For Re = 2e12, \lambda = 2.2e-6 L
  - This means that the Reynolds number at the Taylor scale is 2e12 2.2e-6 = 4,400,000
  - Still very big!!
- This is still much smaller than we could ever see in an H II region
  - In Orion, L = 2 r_0 = 0.14 pc, so \lambda = 3e-7 pc = 6e13 cm = 0.06 AU
  - In 30 Dor, L = 8 pc, so \lambda = 3.6 AU
- Mean velocities at the Taylor scale, assuming M = 1 @ L and V ~ r^{m/2}
  - m = 1 : V = 0.015 km/s
  - m = 2/3 : V = 0.13 km/s

    
** Kolmogorov scale, \eta
- The scale below which viscosity dominates
- \eta / L = Re^(-3/4) = 2e12^(-3/4) = 6e-10
  - Orion: \eta = 2600 km
  - 30 Dor: \eta = 0.001 au = 0.2 Rsun

* Turbulent dissipation rate

** Relevant papers

*** Elsinga et al 2020
Title: /Extreme dissipation and intermittency in turbulence at very high Reynolds numbers/

: For homogeneous isotropic turbulence, the dissipation variance is directly related to the flatness factor of the longitudinal velocity gradient [19,20], which increases with Reynolds number [15,17,20].

Also

: Presently, there is no suitable theory to explain the observed Reynolds number dependence of the dissipation PDF, its variance and also its extremes.

Should note that they are only doing incompressible turbulence

They find that the mean-square dissipation divided by square of the mean dissipation increases significantly with Reynolds number. This is what should create the temperature fluctuations.

They calculate this from a quantity called F
: the flatness, F, of the longitudinal velocity gradient
which is defined as the ratio of the fourth moment to the square of the second moment of the longitudinal velocity gradient.

This is related to the dissipation rate by
: F = 15 \langle \epsilon^2 \rangle / 7 \langle \epsilon \rangle^2
and they say that
: the normalized dissipation variance is given by ((7/15) 𝐹 − 1)
although I am not sure where the -1 comes from.

This does not matter since F \approx 100 for Re_\lambda = 1e4, which is the sort of regime we are interested in. Note that Re_\lambda is the Taylor scale Reynolds number, which is of order the square-root of the integral-scale Reynolds number.

They show their own model prediction and a single power-law from Gylfason et al 2004 ([[id:05430AD7-562A-4CD8-AFBB-A6FB1F603454][see below]]). These both fit the observational data equally well, but they diverge significantly at high Re_\lambda, with the current paper predicting much higher values from the increasing power more slope as the nested sub-structures ans sub-sub-structures are added.

An empirical study, aimed at measuring

They calculate the flatness, which they call the
: derivative kurtosis, K_(∂u/∂x) ≡ ⟨(∂u/∂x)^4⟩/⟨(∂u/∂x)^2⟩^2
(the definition is exactly the same as F in Elsinga).

They find that a single power law fits their observational data adequately well on the range 100 \le R_λ \le 900:
: K_∂u/∂x ∼ R_\lambda^0.39

They have an alternative way of specifying the Taylor microscale:
: \lambda =[ U^2 ⟨u^2⟩ / ⟨(∂u/∂t)^2⟩ ]^(1/2)

  

*** Cho & Lazarian 2003
Title: /Compressible Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence: Mode Coupling, Scaling Relations, Anisotropy, Eddy Energetics, and Intermittency/

Has direct simulations of compressible MHD turbulence in a box, with a variety of sonic and Alfvenic Mach numbers. They include low-beta and high-beta cases (the latter are more relevant to us, since we expect the magnetic pressure to be sub-dominant in H II regions).

They mention that even in high-beta plasmas (magnetic pressure unimportant at the large scales), that because the turbulent velocity fluctuations decrease with scale, then at small enough scales the magnetic pressure will become important.
- /My comments on this:/ this is all very well, but
  1. [ ] The magnetic pressure is still smaller than the thermal pressure. I guess that the thermal pressure /fluctuations/ are smaller though, so they will be affected by the anisotropy of the magnetic field.
  2. [ ] Also, how to reconcile with the claims of the Elsinga 2020 paper that for high Reynolds numbers the velocity differences across the "significant shear layers" are of order the mean velocity?



*** Goldreich & Sridhar 1995
Title: /Toward a theory of interstellar turbulence. 2: Strong Alfvenic turbulence/

This is still in the incompressible regime, but builds on a previous paper, which treated weak Alfven turbulence.

They find that "eddies" (scare quotes are theirs) are elongated along the magnetic fields lines, increasingly so at smaller scales:
- k_z / k_\perp = (L k_\perp)^{-1/3}

*** Goldreich & Sridhar 2006
Title: /FOLDED FIELDS AS THE SOURCE OF EXTREME RADIO-WAVE SCATTERING IN THE GALACTIC CENTER/

This paper is the first to walk back the idea that pulsar scintillation requires large-amplitude density fluctuations at very small scales in the ISM. Instead the propose folded magnetic sheets, an idea that is developed much more fully by Ue-Li Pen.

They talk of turbulent heating rates in terms of timescales. And compare them with the radiative cooling timescale

*** Ocker et al 2024a
Title: /Implications for Galactic Electron Density Structure from Pulsar Sightlines Intersecting HII Regions/

Has a bizarre complicated cloudlet mode for H II regions that has 3 different density variation parameters.
- [ ] Refers to some earlier papers, which I should check out
- They do seem to have anticipated my f = 1 / (1 + s^2) result, where s is the coefficient of variation, stddev / mean. 

*** Ocker et al 2024b
Title: /Pulsar scintillation through thick and thin: bow shocks, bubbles, and the broader interstellar medium/ 
- By bow shocks, they mean pulsar bow shocks, so it is not of such interest as I had first thought.


* Other factors
In case the intermittent turbulent dissipation is not enough to reproduce the observed t^2, here are some additional factors that might help:

** Compressibility
- Nearly all of the theoretical and experimental work is done on incompressible turbulence, but we have RMS Mach numbers from 0.5 to 1.5, and even higher for the most luminous regions. How this affects the Reynolds number scaling of the dissipation rate is unknown. 

** Isothermality and the Bernoulli entropy ratchet
- The fact that we have an efficient photo-electric heating mechanism means that we can maintain an isothermal equation of state in the compressible turbulent cascade, so long as the dynamic time remains longer than the heating time.
- I think this means that we extract energy from the radiation field, via repeated isothermal expansions (entropy conserving) and shock compressions (entropy increasing), which increase the Bernoulli constant of the gas.
  - Expansion satisfy 0.5 v^2 + c_s^2 ln  \rho = b_0
  - Shocks satisfy \rho_2 = M^2 \rho_1; v_2 = v_1 / M^2
  - So we can imagine a cycle
    - Start with \rho_0, v_0 = 0
    - Accelerate to v_1 = M c_s
      - c_s^2 ln \rho_0 = b_0 = c_s^2 ln \rho_1 + 0.5 M^2 c_s^2
      - => \rho_1 = \rho_0 exp(-0.5 M^2)
    - Now have a perpendicular shock of strength M
      - \rho_2 = \rho_1 M^2 = \rho_0 exp(-0.5 M^2) M^2
      - v_2 = v_1 / M^2 = c_s / M
      - b_2 = 0.5 v_2^2 + c_s^2 ln \rho_2
        = 0.5 c_s^2 / M^2 + c_s^2 ln [\rho_0 exp(-0.5 M^2) M^2]
        = c_s^2 { 0.5/M^2 + ln \rho_0 - 0.5 M^2 + ln M^2 }
    - Put M = 1 + m with m \ll 1
      - 1/M^2 = 1 - 2m + 3m^2 - 4m^3 + 5m^4 + ...
      - M^2 = 1 + 2m + m^2
      - ln M^2 = 2m - m^2 + (2/3) m^3 - (1/2) m^4 + ...
    - b_2/c_s^2 = ln \rho_0 + 0.5 (1 - 2m + 3m^2 - 4m^3 + 5m^4) - 0.5 (1 + 2m + m^2) + 2m - m^2 + (2/3) m^3 - (1/2) m^4
      - constant term: ln \rho_0 + 0.5 - 0.5 = ln \rho_0
      - m term: -1 - 1 + 2 = 0
      - m^2 term: 1.5 - 0.5 - 1 = 0
      - m^3 term: -2 + 0 + 2/3 = -4/3
      - m^4 term: 2.5 - 0 - 0.5 = 2a
  - So this actually decreases the Bernoulli constant, which is not what I wanted
    - To leading order, b_2 = b_0 - (4/3) m^3 for M = 1 + m
- The whole idea is misconceived because the Bernoulli law only applies to steady-state flow, which makes absolutely no sense in a turbulent cascade.
