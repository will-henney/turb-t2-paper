# turb-t2-paper
New idea for title
    > Temperature variations from intermittent turbulent energy dissipation in H II regions
	
Draft of a paper with working title
    > Scaling laws for turbulent H II regions

Original title was 
    > Turbulence-driven temperature fluctuations in H II regions
	
but I wanted something a bit more general
